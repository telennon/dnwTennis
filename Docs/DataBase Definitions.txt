DataBase Definitions

dnwTennis v3 utilizes MongoDB a document database so does not have a schema per se. There are however definitions of data
expected to be in the collections and expectations for what the collections are used for.

Camps
	Camps is the collection of camps and sections for each camp - This database is created by the camp coordinator using a camp creation page available on the manager's website.

	id: MongoDB assigned ID
	Title: Frindly name for the camp
	Active: Indicates if the camp is the current camp or a historical camp. This may be removed in the future as 
		it might be better to do this with a date rather then a flag that needs to be explicitly set and any
		autmated setting would rely on a date anyway
	Cost: The cost of the camp - To internationalize, will need to add a currency type field
	RegStart - Defines the date and time at which registration begins
	RegEnd - Defines the date and time at which registration for camp ends
	RefundDeadline - The date and time at which refunds will no longer be granted. If nil then there is no refund deadline
	CamperTypes - Used to define the types of campers - For the DNW camps this is Homeowner and Guest but could be
		anything
	Sections - A set of documents that define each section of camp
		id: MongoDB generated ID
		Name: Friendly name for this section
		Start: Starting date and time of section
		End: Ending date and time of section
		CostDifferential: a positive or negative number to adjust the Cost defined above. This allows different sections to be charged different ammounts.
